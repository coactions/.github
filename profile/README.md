## coactions :: Community Actions for Github

The goal of `coactions` github organization is to develop and maintain github actions in a **collaborative way, community based**.

This approach should protect against a very common maintenance problem: their original author is no longer able to help maintaining the code, 
sometimes not even being possible to containt. Like any code, actions are prone to rot and we want to fight this.

This model worked fine in other cases with similar github organizations like [jazzband](https://jazzband.co/)
